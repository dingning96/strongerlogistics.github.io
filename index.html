                        <b>Good vs Right Achievement: </b> <br>
	• 135 good opportunities were identified in total.<br>
	• 97 have been eliminated/optimized. <br>
	• 1696 working hours, around 2% AP logistics employees' efforts have been released in the 1st half year.   <br>
	<b>Good Vs Right- Best practice sharing: </b> <br>
	• <u><i>Reduce repetitive  manual work </i></u><br>
SEA RTW team identified manual input for each item when creating service PO is a repetitive task every year. They worked with Ada Fan & DSS to turn on 'copy function' in ECC.
 This simple change could improve productivity from 3.5 hours to 0.5 hour.<br>
	• <u><i>Process rationalization</i></u><br>
APAC MPC/Air team developed the statistic analyze model to improve the accuracy of transit time configured in SAP instead of manual intervention in the past. The new approach save whole team monthly efforts from 22 hours to 12 hours while enhancing reliability of delivery confirmation date to customers in dynamic ocean marking.<br>
	<b>WIIFM (What is it for me?)</b> <br>
	• Good vs right is not only one time activity, keep “good Vs right” mindset in my daily work. <br>
	• share good practice/examples with two ambassadors across the region <br>
