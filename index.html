                        <b>Good vs Right Achievement: </b> <br>
	• 135 good opportunities were identified in total.<br>
	• 97 have been eliminated/optimized. <br>
	• 1696 working hours, around 2% AP logistics employees' efforts have been released in the 1st half year.   <br>
	<b>Good Vs Right- Best practice sharing: </b> <br>
	• <u><i>Reduce repetitive  manual work </i></u><br>
Manual input for each service PO item was identified by SEA RTW team as a repetitive task. They worked with Ada Fan & DSS to turn on 'copy function' in ECC.
 This simple change released 2 hours (2 hours per year? per person?) in task completion <br>
	• <u><i>Process rationalization</i></u><br>
APAC MPC/Air team developed the statistic analyze model to improve the accuracy of transit time configured in SAP instead of manual intervention in the past. The new approach save whole team monthly efforts from 22 hours to 12 hours while enhancing reliability of delivery confirmation date to customers in dynamic ocean marking.<br>
	<b>What is it for me?</b> <br>
	• Good vs Right is not only one time activity.  Keep the mindset and find opportunities in the daily work, no matter big or small.  <br>
	• The more opportunities can be identified and implemented, the more time can be utilized on improvement and value adding initiatives, and personal growth actions in learning and practice. <br>
	• share good practice/examples with two ambassadors (Jason Liu & Candy Yao) across the region, so to learn and leverage among people and teams.  <br>
